# cdss-lib-cdss-python #

Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) library for CDSS shared code (Python).

This library is a port of Java code to evaluate implementing StateMod software in Python.
Currently the library is not needed and therefore the repository contains no source code files.

See the [cdss-app-statemod-python repository](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-python) for documentation.
